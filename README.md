# Hierarchical_Data_Tree
<!-- This app uses Django and Django-MPTT

By using the MPTT models the app allows you to store folders and
files in a tree structure, sorting the parent-child relationships
between multiple files. This is handled through the model for the 
files where you have the option to choose the parent-object of each
file/folder. --> save this
